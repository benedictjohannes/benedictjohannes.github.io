# Color Guessing Game in Vanilla Javascript

This is my version of the Color Guessing Game, just for fun.
The Color Game is a game to guess randomly generated RGB colors.

The game is not my creation, it is taught as educational coding in Colt Steele's "Web Developer Bootcamp", available at https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/.

While the game taught in the bootcamp works well, I have created some modification in my version:
- Number of squares dropdown, instead of Easy/Hard button (representing 3/6 choices).
- Number of color level for each channel (less color level being easier).
- Single function to initiate the game, with buttons/HTML dropdown being assigned Javascript functions instead of adding event listeners.
- "Loading" welcome text using setTimeout to add game feel.

To play the game (view the page), click on [./colorGame.html].
