# Benedict's Code Sharing

This is just my personal code sharing space.

Some viewable contents:
- [Cloudflare DNS Entries Quick Changer](https://github.com/benedictjohannes/express-react-cloudflare-dns-conf), written with Node.JS + Express with React frontend. This allows quick setting of DNS entries in Cloudflare, when opening Cloudflare's dash interface takes more time than we're ready to allocate. 
- [Firestore + Firebase Webapp React Hook boilerplate + Invoice App](https://github.com/benedictjohannes/react-hook-redux-firebase-auth-firestore-invoice), implementing Firebase auth and firestore database. When this app was written, not very much boilerplate code exist for Firebase/Firestore that utilize React Hooks, which is in my experience a superiorly easier way to write components. React components in this project are purely functional components utilyzing React Hooks. The invoice app is basically a multitenant simple invoice authoring with automatic calculation of invoice entries, with sharable invoice links, invoice status tracking and interface to manage invoice sent to / from the currently logged in user's organization (multiple organization is possible). The live version of the complete invoice app is in [invoice.encelerate.com](https://invoice.encelerate.com).
- [Tic-tac-toe game](https://github.com/benedictjohannes/follow-react-tic-tac-toe) following React's excellent [starter tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html), my first foray into React. [Play the game?](https://benedictjohannes.github.io/follow-react-tic-tac-toe/)
- [Color Guessing Game](./colorGame) in Vanilla JS, written following Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp when learning to code. I'd love to say I wouldn't write it the way I did back then, but it makes me feel old. [Play the game?](./colorGame/colorGame.html)
